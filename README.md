# Unity-flight-simulator

Flight simulator made with UNITY.

This was one of my first projects that got me into computer programming.
Started working on as a hobby project in 2017 when I was in grade 8.
My first build video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21qiJmZ_UMs

Simulates the Airbus A320 aircraft.
1. Autopilot
2. Fly-by wire system
3. Hydraulics, bleed air, and fuel system.
4. Interactive cockpit.
